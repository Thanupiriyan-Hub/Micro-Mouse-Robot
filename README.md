# 2024 Maze-Solving Micro Mouse Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the **Maze-Solving Micro Mouse Robot** project developed for a robotics competition in 2024. The project implements a maze-solving algorithm using flood-fill techniques for autonomous navigation through a maze.

## Team
- **Thanupiriyan Sannithy** (Team Leader)
- **Tharsan I.**
- **Kalainilavan I.**

## Features
- Flood-fill maze-solving algorithm
- Integration of TOF sensors and gyroscope for real-time navigation
- Codebase for STM32 microcontroller using PlatformIO

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-solving-micromouse-2024.git
Build and upload the project to your STM32 board using PlatformIO.
