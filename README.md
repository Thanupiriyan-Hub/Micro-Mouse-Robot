# Maze-Solving Micro Mouse Project

![Intro](./Images/Robofest.jfif)

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the **Maze-Solving Micro Mouse Robot** project developed for a robotics competition in 2022. The robot uses a flood-fill algorithm to navigate a maze autonomously and determine the shortest path to the goal.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**:  
> The flood-fill algorithm logic used in this competition is **not included** in this repository.  
> Only the sensor-related libraries and necessary interface functions are shared here.

## Competition Format
The competition was based on the classic **Micro Mouse challenge**, where the task is to navigate a **16√ó16 cell maze**, with each cell measuring **16‚ÄØcm √ó 16‚ÄØcm**. The objective is for the robot to autonomously find and travel the **shortest path to the center** of the maze in the least possible time.

Each team had to develop their own algorithms, hardware integration, and path-planning logic to efficiently guide their robot from the start position to the goal (center) and back.

## Flood-Fill Algorithm in Action
To solve the maze, we used a **flood-fill algorithm**, which plays a critical role in path planning. Here‚Äôs how it works in our robot:

- Initially, all cells in the maze are assigned a value based on their distance from the center (goal).
- The robot scans its surroundings using TOF distance sensors and updates the map with known walls.
- Based on flood-fill values, it chooses the neighboring cell with the **lowest value** and proceeds in that direction.
- As new walls are discovered, the maze is dynamically updated, and the algorithm recalculates the shortest route.
- Once the center is reached, a final optimized path is executed for high-speed traversal.

This allowed our robot to **adapt in real-time** and optimize its movement as it explored.

## Hardware Components Used
The following components were used in the robot's design and build:

- üîß **N20 Gear Motors** with Magnetic Encoders (300‚ÄØRPM)
- üì¶ **STM32F103C8T6 "Blue Pill" Microcontroller**
- üß≠ **Gyroscope Sensor**
- üìè **VL53L0X Time-of-Flight (TOF) Distance Sensors**
- üìè **Ultrasonic Distance Sensors**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **2x D-Hole Wheels** (32‚ÄØmm diameter)
- ‚ö™ **1x Castor Ball Wheel** (free-rotating for stability)
- üîä **Buzzer** (for signaling status or errors)
